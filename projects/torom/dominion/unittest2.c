/*
* Name: Matthew Toro
* onid: torom
* Class: CS 362 Software Engineering II
* Program: unittest2.c
* Due Date: 2/4/2018
* Description: A unit test for the function 'fullDeckCount' in dominion.c
*/

/*
FUNCTION TO BE TESTED: FULLDECKCOUNT
REQUIREMENTS FOR FUNCTION: 

WHAT IS THIS FUNCTION SUPPOSED TO DO?
Count the passed in card argument among a player's deck, hand, and discard pile

HOW DOES FULLDECKCOUNT AFFECT THE GAME STATE?
It does not affect the game's state.
It checks if a card is present in state.deck, state.hand, and state.discard but it does not modify those values
There are no apparent edge cases in this function.
*/

/*
WHAT TO TEST:
DECK COUNT REMAIN THE SAME
priorDeckCount == afterDeckCount:
where priorDeckCount = state->deckCount[player] before calling fullDeckCount
and afterDeckCount = state->deckCount[player] after calling fullDeckCount

AND
LIST OF CARDS IN DECK REMAIN THE SAME
priorCardList[deckCount] == afterCardList[deckCount]
where priorCardList = state->deck[player][i=0...deckCount] before calling fullDeckCount
and afterCardList = state->deck[player][i=0...deckCount] after calling fullDeckCount

AND
HAND COUNT REMAIN THE SAME
priorHandCount == afterHandCount:
where priorHandCount = state->handCount[player] before calling fullDeckCount
and afterDeckCount = state->handCount[player] after calling fullDeckCount

AND
LIST OF CARDS IN HAND REMAIN THE SAME
priorHandList[handCount] == afterHandList[handCount]
where priorHandList = state->hand[player][i=0...handCount] before calling fullDeckCount
and afterHandList = state->hand[player][i=0...handCount] after calling fullDeckCount

AND
DISCARD COUNT REMAINS THE SAME
priorDiscardCount == afterDiscardCount:
where priorDiscardCount = state->discardCount[player] before calling fullDeckCount
and afterDiscardCount = state->discardCount[player] after calling fullDeckCount

AND
LIST OF CARDS IN DISCARD REMAINS THE SAME
priorDiscardList[discardCount] == afterDiscardList[discardCount]
where priorDiscardList = state->discard[player][i=0...discardCount] before calling fullDeckCount
and afterDiscardList = state->discard[player][i=0...discardCount] after calling fullDeckCount

AND
RETURNS CORRECT 'CARD' COUNT
That is, if the player has seven coppers, then count should return 7
